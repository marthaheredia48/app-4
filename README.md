**Quiz App - Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022**

This project is my fourth iOS app, developed during the Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022. This app is a fun and interactive quiz about me, designed to test how well the user knows me. It showcases my growing skills in app development by incorporating multiple-choice questions and dynamic feedback.

**Features**

-Quiz Introduction: The main screen displays a text box with the message "Do you know me?", inviting users to take the quiz.


-Multiple-Choice Questions:


  -->The quiz consists of three questions, each with three possible answers.


  -->Users can select an answer by tapping on it, and the app will provide immediate feedback indicating whether the chosen answer is correct or incorrect.


-Navigation Between Questions:


  -->After answering a question, users can click the "Next Question" button to proceed to the next question in the quiz.


  -->This feature is repeated for each of the three questions, culminating in a final question with a similar structure.


**Purpose**

The purpose of this app was to create a more interactive and engaging experience by incorporating a quiz format. It allowed me to explore conditional logic, user feedback, and navigation between different screens within the app, enhancing my understanding of how to build more complex applications.


**Learning Experience**

This project provided valuable insights into:

-Implementing multiple-choice questions and tracking user input.


-Providing dynamic feedback based on user selections.


-Navigating between different screens within a multi-question quiz format.


-Utilizing conditional logic to determine and display correct and incorrect answers.
